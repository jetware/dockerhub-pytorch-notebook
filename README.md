# PyTorch Notebook

A pre-configured and fully integrated minimal runtime environment with PyTorch, an open source software library for machine learning, Jupyter Notebook, a browser-based interactive notebook for programming, mathematics, and data science, and the Python programming language.

The stack is built in several variations with different hardware optimization features: OpenBLAS and Intel MKL for x86 CPU, and CUDA for NVidia GPU.
